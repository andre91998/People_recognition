# Pedestrian Recognition via OpenCV's HOG + Linear SVM
  Inspired by Andrew Rosebrock @ https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/11/09/pedestrian-detection-opencv/

## Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

While OpenCV's Cascade Classifiers are fast, they leave much to desire. That's where HOG comes in. But if you want to check out cascade classifiers, a java application for face recognition can be found ![here](https://github.com/andre91998/JavaBasics/tree/master/FaceDetection).



## Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM)
